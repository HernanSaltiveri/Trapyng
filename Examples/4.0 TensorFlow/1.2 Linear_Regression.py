"""
In this document we will perform a basic Linear Regression including TensorBoard.
In this case we will defina proper naming of the elements of the graph, both operations
and variables. And we will record in tensorBoard the evolution of the training loss.
We will:
    - Define placeholders for the input variables
    - Define the operations to compute the output.
    - Define a loss function over the output.
    - Defina an optimizer for training.
