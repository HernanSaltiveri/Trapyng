    "BACKGROUND: \n",
    "In VAE exercise for DL course, the variational free energy loss function (aka ELBO) has 2 terms: (1) the reconstruction\n",
    "error of the decoder, and (2) the KL divergence between our approximate posterior (aka z or latent distribution) and \n",
    "the prior we provide. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "CONNECTION WITH BAYES BY BACKPROP:\n",
    "Just as the VAE loss function optimizes for the parameters of the latent distribution (while keeping the reconstruction\n",
    "error at bay) the loss function in Blundell (Bayes by Backprop loss) optimizes for the parameters (\\mu, \\sigma) that\n",
    "define the weight distribution of our neural network (while keeping accuracy error at bay). \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, to implement Bayes by Backprop, we simply have to borrow the VAE loss function - this will allow us to \n",
    "approximate the true distribution of the neural network's weights. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "DATA BATCHING:\n",
    "If our training set contains M number of samples (i.e. sentences in our case) and B number of batches (called \n",
    "mini-batches in Fortunato et al 2017), then we will have C = M/B number of samples per batch. Further, let's assume\n",
    "that each sample/sentence contains 35 elements/words. \n",
    "\n",
    "BAYES BY BACKPROP THROUGH TIME:\n",
    "I think it's easier to visualize with the unrolled RNN. Let's say that we unroll for 35 time steps (T=35). What this\n",
    "means is that every word in a sentence corresponds to a time step (since the task is next-word prediction). Let's follow \n",
    "the path of a sample/sentence. Assume this sentence, \"The dinosaur likes to go dancing.\" The element \"The\" will go to\n",
    "LSTM_t1; the element \"dinosaur\" will go to LSTM_t2; and so on. \n",
    "\n",
    "I'M IN DOUBT HERE: At each timestep we will also have a y-output predicting what the next word will be in the form of\n",
    "a 10K softmax vector. This means that backpropagation will be computed per word. I.e., we will forward propagate a word\n",
    "through the network, make a next-word prediction, backpropagate given that prediction, and thus obtain gradients per \n",
    "word (and equivalently, per timestep). \n",
    "\n",
    "OPTIMIZATION:\n",
    "Our direction of descent will be the average of the gradients of the C samples per batch. The gradient of each sample,\n",
    "in turn, will be the average of the gradients of the 35 timesteps (i.e. the average of the 35 words). This weighting \n",
    "scheme is used by Fortunato; Blundell experiment with another that might yield better results. \n",
    "\n",
    "Either way, the main take-away is that in order to implement Bayes by Backprop through Time, we need to: \n",
    "    1. Figure out how to get gradients at the word (or timestep) level in tensorflow\n",
    "    2. Tell tensorflow how to weight/average these gradients per step direction.\n",
